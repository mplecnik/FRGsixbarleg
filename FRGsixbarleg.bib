  abstract = {A novel method for four-bar linkages, that satisfies kinematic design requirements and also attains trade-off of dynamic balance, is presented. By properly designing the speed trajectory of the input link, the disk counterweight of moving links, and link dimensions of the given or desired mechanisms, the expected output motion characteristics and dynamic balancing performance are obtained. The input motion characteristics are designed with Bezier curves. Optimization is applied to find out optimal design parameters for reaching the trade-off of dynamic balance. The input speed trajectory of the input link could be generated by a servomotor. Examples are given to demonstrate the design procedure of this approach.},

These paths are so determined as to optimize some quality of the dynamic behavior as the device moves under the action of external forces. A solution technique is presented which transforms the problem into an optimal control problem with the basic ideas being developed using a single link device with one unknown path. It is assumed that the resulting optimal paths could then be realized using existing methods of kinematic synthesis.},

  abstract = {A method of dynamic synthesis of a slider-crank mechanism to meet specified velocity conditions at three design points including the inertia effects of the masses of the main links is presented. Velocity specifications are developed assuming a constant velocity of the input crank. The dynamic velocity error due to inertial effects is calculated by numerical solution of the differential equations of motion including the torque-speed relation for a typical three-phase electrical motor drive. An iterative dynamic-kinematic redesign of the mechanism is used to minimize the velocity error at three design points.

Die Geschwindigkeitswerte unter der Voraussetzung einerkonstanten Umdrehungsgeschwindigkeit der Kurbelwelle angenommen. Der durch die Tr\"agheitseinfl\"usse verursachte dynamische Geschwindigkeitsfeheler wird mittels numerischer Behandlung der Differentialgleichen der Bewegung unter Ber\"uchsichtigung der Beziehung zwischen Drehmoment und Geschwindigkeit f\"ur einen gew\"ohnlichen elektrischen Dreiphasen-Motor berechnet. Eine iterative dynamisch-kinematische Abwandlung des Getriebes wird benutzt, um die Geschwindigkeitsfehler in den drei Pr\"azisionspunkten zu minimisieren.

This paper describes the initial phases in the development of a general method of kineto-elastodynamic analysis and synthesis based on the flexibility approach of structural analysis, which may be applied to any planar or spatial mechanism. Dynamic error is investigated due to flexural, longitudinal, and torsional element strain, and system inertia fluctuations; the treatment of Coulomb and viscous friction is indicated. Kineto-Elastodynamic Stretch Rotation Operators are derived which will rotate and stretch both planar and spatial link vectors reflecting rigid body motion plus elastic deformations of the link.

  abstract = {The design process is briefly discussed under seven headings. This is followed by methods to analyze a linkage mechanism on a static and dynamic basis. A dynamic motion analysis is performed, and pin forces are calculated for the actual conditions of velocity and acceleration. The methods are illustrated throughout by a design example. It is shown that the usual assumption of constant speed at some reference link does not give accurate values of the pin forces. The concept of the transmission angle, used as a criterion to assess a linkage based on the geometry, is supplemented by a new factor which allows the dynamic performance to be appraised. A spring is used to improve the design based on fluctuation of speed and pin forces. A process of optimisation is discussed to synthesize further, or tune the mechanism.
Zusammenfassung
Anwendung der Dynamischen Analyse zur Vervollst\"andigung des Entwurfes eines Getriebes; Dr. M. Skreiner. Der Entwurfsprozess ist kurz besprochen unter sieben Titeln. Dieses ist erweitert durch Methoden der Analyse eines Getriebes auf statischer und dynamischer Grundlagen. Eine dynamische Bewegungsanalyse ist durchgef\"uhrt und die Stiftkr\"afte sind berechnet auf Grund der tats\"achlichen Geschwindigkeits und Beschleunigungs-Zust\"ande. Die Methoden sind durch ein Beispiel erl\"autert. Es wird gezeigt, dass die \"ubliche Annahme einer best\"andigen Geschwindigkeit f\"ur ein gewisses Glied nicht die genauen Gr\"ossen der Stiftk\"afte liefert. Der Begriff des \"Ubertragungswinkels, als Kennzeichen zur Absch\"atzung eines Getriebes auf Grund der Geometrie, ist durch einen neuen Faktor erg\"anzt, welcher die Absch\"atzung der dynamischen Ausf\"uhrung erm\"oglicht. Eine Feder ist angewandt zur Verbesserung des Entwurfes auf Grund des Schwankens der Geschwindigkeit und der Stiftkr\"afte. Ein Verfahren zur Optimisierung ist besprochen f\"ur weitere Synthese oder Abstimmungdes Getriebes.

With this method, mechanisms with elastic links can be designed in a systematic way for a desired performance at high speeds. This is achieved by first performing the kinematic synthesis of the mechanism considering its links to be rigid, and then proportioning the areas of cross section of the links optimally to account for kineto-elastodynamic effects. Design optimization with respect to stress level, mass distribution and elastic deflections is performed by imposing constraints on dynamic stresses in every link and on the deflections of the path or function generating links throughout the range of motion. The optimization problem is formulated in terms of nonlinear programming techniques. Numerical examples are presented. The KED design procedure, which is developed and demonstrated here by way of several examples, is believed to be the first method of this kind for a completely elastic mechanism.},

It is shown that certain gear-coupled manipulators can be designed to possess kinematic isotropy property at a given end-effector position.

The second-stage reduction can be uniquely determined from the kinematic isotropic conditions, while the first-stage reduction can be determined from dynamic considerations. This approach, through proper choice of gear ratios, can provide these gear-coupled manipulators with desired kinematic and dynamic characteristics.},

Design tasks for function generation and motion transmission are addressed in the current study. The basic idea of the present approach is to provide a computational framework for design synthesis by imitating the common design method of reviewing past designs to obtain solution concepts for a new design problem. A notion of virtual function generators is introduced to conceptualize and represent underlying design concepts contained in existing mechanisms. Virtual function generators are derived from previous designs, and serve as new conceptual building blocks for conceptual synthesis of mechanisms. Feasible design alternatives are generated by combining virtual function generators using some adaptation rules. The reuse of prior design concepts is accomplished via virtual function generators within the framework of case-based reasoning. The approach is demonstrated through an application.},

A revolute jointed planar parallel manipulator is used as an example to demonstrate the methodology. The parameters describing the manipulator geometry are obtained from the first optimisation procedure, and subsequently, the mass distribution parameters of the manipulator are determined from the second optimisation procedure based on force balancing. Optimisation results indicate that the proposed optimisation approach is systematic, versatile and easy to implement for the optimum synthesis of the parallel manipulator and other kinematic chains. This work contributes to previously published work from the point of view of being a systematic approach to the optimum synthesis of parallel manipulators, which is currently lacking in the literature.},

The mass, the center position of mass and the moment of inertia the moving links are taken as the optimizing variables. The objective functions are taken as the changes of the amplitude and direction of the joint forces and they are minimized. The optimized result shows that the magnitude of joint force can be controlled hardly to change and the direction of joint force can be controlled to change smoothly with respect to the crank angle, although the clearances exist at the joints. The link shape can be formed with the optimized variables by using the small element superposing method (SESM) and a design example is given.},

Zusammenfassung
Es wird eine Literatur\"ubersicht \"uber den Kr\"afte- und Momentenausgleich in Koppelgetrieben gegeben. Sie stellt sowohl eine Erg\"anzung als auch eine Weiterf\"uhrung von zwei fr\"uheren \"Ubersichten /14/ und /52/ der Autoren dar. Die Arbeit ist motiviert durch das weit verbreitete Bestreben, Ger\"ausch-, Dauerfestigkeits- und Verschlei\ss{}probleme zu verh\"uten, die ihren Ursprung in der \"Ubertragung von unausgeglichenen Kr\"aften und Momenten auf Maschinenfundamente haben. Die Beschreibungen sind im allgemeinen auf den teilweisen und vollst\"andigen Ausgleich ebener und r\"aumlicher Getriebe, der mittels Massenumverteilung oder durch Zusatzmassen erreicht werden kann, beschr\"ankt. Der Ausgleich durch doppelte oder spiegelsymmetrische Anordnungen zweier gleicher Getriebe wird nicht behandelt. Bis auf besondere Ausnahmen werden auch Ausgleichsgetriebe an Schubkurbeln, die in Verbrennungsmotoren, Pumpen und Verdichten f\"ur den Ausgleich Anwendung finden, ausgeschlossen. Um ein m\"oglichst vollkommenes Bild zu geben, werden noch einmal einige schon in den \"Ubersichten von 1968 und 1977 gegebene Literaturstellen behandelt. Aus \"ahnlichen Gr\"unden wurden Arbeiten \"uber Federn, D\"ampfer und Gegenmassen mit minimalen Massentr\"agheitsmomenten einbezogen. Obwohl der Antriebsmomentenausgleich eng mit dem Kr\"afteausgleich verwandt ist, wird dieses Feld nur in der zus\"atzlichen Literaturliste erw\"ahnt. Hierzu wird der Leser auf eine \"Ubersicht von R.

  abstract = {Abstract, This paper proposes a novel concept for reducing driving torque fluctuations of planar linkages by the application of non-circular gears. The circular gears normally used in gear linkage mechanisms are replaced by a pair of non-circular gears. The design method includes two individual stages: linkage synthesis and gear ratio synthesis. An optimization model is developed for determining the appropriate transmission ratio function of the non-circular gear pair to meet user-specified requirements and constraints. Two examples are given to demonstrate this method and to verify its feasibility.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, mechanisms are driven by constant velocity motors. A real-time controllable (RTC) mechanism refers to the mechanism driven by servomotors, which can be planned and scheduled in real-time. Robot manipulators are typical examples of the RTC mechanisms. The generic task of an RTC mechanism is the trajectory or motion tracking. This paper describes an integrated approach to design an RTC mechanism considering force balancing and trajectory tracking, simultaneously. In particular, a new approach called adjusting kinematic parameter (AKP) for the force balancing of RTC mechanisms is described. The force balanced mechanism has simpler dynamics, and thus facilitates the development of control systems for performing trajectory tracking. This paper demonstrates that the force balanced mechanism by the AKP approach is more promising than those by other approaches in terms of the reduction of joint forces and torques in servomotors, and improvement of the trajectory tracking performance. Based on simulation, this paper also shows the effects of two different control systems: PD and non-linear PD versus the AKP approach and the counterweight approach.},

The long-term goal of the research consists in enhancing the operation of parallel spatial robots by means of optimal balancing strategies. This contribution is primarily meant to provide the analysis method of the research and, for this purpose, it focuses on the planar four-bar linkage, intended as the simplest example of closed-chain mechanism. Firstly an original approach for the static balancing of planar linkages by means of constant-force generators is proposed. The implemented formulation, which permits to compute the balancing parameters of both counterweights and/or springs, is adopted for deriving a mass balanced and an elastically compensated variant of the studied four-bar linkage, respectively. Then the operation of the unbalanced linkage and its two balanced variants is numerically studied. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of these mechanisms are estimated by modal analysis, whereas the dynamic performance at different operating regimes is assessed by kineto-elastodynamic investigation and finally discussed.},

We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for immediate incentive compatibility for mechanisms that satisfy periodic ex post incentive compatibility in future periods. The result also yields a strikingly simple mechanism for selling a sequence of items to a single buyer. We also show that the allocation rule of the virtual-pivot mechanism has a very simple structure (a virtual index) in multiarmed bandit settings.

  abstract = {A new versatile hydraulically powered quadruped robot (HyQ) has been developed to serve as a platform to study not only highly dynamic motions, such as running and jumping, but also careful navigation over very rough terrain. HyQ stands 1\,m tall, weighs roughly 90\,kg, and features 12 torque-controlled joints powered by a combination of hydraulic and electric actuators. The hydraulic actuation permits the robot to perform powerful and dynamic motions that are hard to achieve with more traditional electrically actuated robots. This paper describes design and specifications of the robot and presents details on the hardware of the quadruped platform, such as the mechanical design of the four articulated legs and of the torso frame, and the configuration of the hydraulic power system. Results from the first walking experiments are presented, along with test studies using a previously built prototype leg.},

  abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design principles for highly efficient legged robots, the implementation of the principles in the design of the MIT Cheetah, and the analysis of the high-speed trotting experimental results. The design principles were derived by analyzing three major energy-loss mechanisms in locomotion: heat losses from the actuators, friction losses in transmission, and the interaction losses caused by the interface between the system and the environment. Four design principles that minimize these losses are discussed: employment of high torque-density motors, energy regenerative electronic system, low loss transmission, and a low leg inertia. These principles were implemented in the design of the MIT Cheetah; the major design features are large gap diameter motors, regenerative electric motor drivers, single-stage low gear transmission, dual coaxial motors with composite legs, and the differential actuated spine. The experimental results of fast trotting are presented; the 33-kg robot runs at 22 km/h (6 m/s). The total power consumption from the battery pack was 973 W and resulted in a total cost of transport of 0.5, which rivals running animals' at the same scale. 76\% of the total energy consumption is attributed to heat loss from the motor, and the remaining 24\% is used in mechanical work, which is dissipated as interaction loss as well as friction losses at the joint and transmission.},

While SEAs have been used in numerous robotic systems, no comprehensive understanding of an optimal design exists. This paper presents a new analytical basis for maximizing an SEA thrust performance for jumping from rest with an articulated leg. The analytical SEA model is validated with simulation and experimental results from a prototype leg. An SEA decouples the dynamic limitations of a dc motor actuator from the joint, allowing larger lift-off velocities than with a directly driven joint. A detailed analysis of the complex dynamic response of an SEA during the thrust phase leads to a new maximum impulse criterion, where motor speed is approximately half the no-load speed at the moment of peak motor torque. The analytical model and this proposed criterion are used to develop a simple equation for selecting SEA design parameters. Lastly, a novel unidirectional SEA design is presented that allows for accurate positioning of the leg during flight.},

We define the inertial reorientation template, the simplest model of this behavior, and leverage its linear dynamics to reveal the design constraints linking a task with the body designs capable of completing it. As practicable inertial appendage designs lead to morphology that is generally more complex, we advance a notion of ``anchoring,'' whereby a judicious choice of physical design in concert with an appropriate control policy yields a system whose closed-loop dynamics are sufficiently captured by the template to permit all further designs to take place in its far simpler parameter space. This approach is effective and accurate over the diverse design spaces afforded by existing platforms, enabling a performance comparison through the shared task space. We analyze examples from the literature and find advantages to each body type, but conclude that tails provide the highest potential performance for reasonable designs. Thus motivated, we build a physical example by retrofitting a tail to a RHex robot and present empirical evidence of its efficacy.},

Targeted at toe placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown; and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This analysis leads to an unconventional design whose ``knee'' joint rides above the ``hip'' joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design.},

  abstract = {Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in robotics research. Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the ``impact mitigation factor'' (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.},

GOAT's kinematics, mechanical design, actuation, drive electronics, and control algorithms are presented. Experimental results successfully demonstrate a mechanically robust GOAT leg performing a) explosive vertical jumping up to 82 cm b) landing using high fidelity virtual compliance and c) high-speed omnidirectional running/jumping trajectories while mounted on a test rig.},

Recently there has been an increasing interest in the notion of embodiment not only in robotics and artificial intelligence, but also in neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of morphological computation and demonstrate how it can be exploited on the one hand for designing intelligent, adaptive robotic systems, and on the other for understanding natural systems. While embodiment has often been used in its trivial meaning, i.e. ``intelligence requires a body'', the concept has deeper and more important implications, concerned with the relation between physical and information (neural, control) processes. Morphological computation is about connecting body, brain and environment. A number of case studies are presented to illustrate the concept. We conclude with some speculations about potential lessons for neuroscience and robotics, in particular for building brain-like intelligence, and we present a theoretical scheme that can be used to embed the diverse case studies.},

In this dynamic regime, passive stabilization is needed for roll-and-pitch instability. However, we have found that certain roll-oscillation modes can be used for continuous high speed turning. Other continuous turning modes have also been identified, such as modulating foot contact location through foot compliance, and controlling differential leg velocity. For the small minimally actuated robots examined, the dynamically enhanced roll-steer mode showed the best turning rate, of over 8 degrees per step, but only appears at certain running frequencies. Interstride phase and velocity control appears promising as a mode for in-plane maneuverability for under-actuated robots.},

In this paper we describe a new method for defining a homotophy to find all solutions to a polynomial system. A major feature of this new approach is that the homotopy need not to be ``generic'' or ``random.'' The practical consequences are that the homotopy may be chosen to more closely resemble the system being solved, with a consequent potential for reducing the arc length of paths and exploiting special structures in the original system. In particular, if the system is naturally m-homogeneous, then the number of homotopy paths that need to be tracked is reduced. Since many systems that arise in applications have such a structure, this represents a significant advance over previous homotopies. We also provide a proof that the homotopy parameter is strictly increasing on homotopy paths as a function of arc length, a new result which has implications for the choice of numerical path-tracking algorithms.},

The method allows equations to be introduced one-by-one or in groups, obtaining at each stage a representation of the solution set that can be extended to the next stage until finally obtaining the solution set for the entire system. At any stage where positive dimensional solution components must be found, they are sliced down to isolated points by the introduction of hyperplanes. By moving these hyperplanes, one may build up the solution set to an intermediate system in which a union of hyperplanes ``regenerates'' the intersection of the component with the variety of the polynomial (or system of polynomials) brought in at the next stage. The theory underlying the approach guarantees that homotopy paths lead to all isolated solutions, and this capability can be used to generate witness supersets for solution components at any dimension, the first step in computing an irreducible decomposition of the solution set of a system of polynomial equations. The method is illustrated on several challenging problems, where it proves advantageous over both the polyhedral homotopy method and the diagonal equation-by-equation method, formerly the two leading approaches to solving sparse polynomial systems by numerical continuation.},

  abstract = {We establish the theory for a very general approach to constructing homotopies for computing all geometrically isolated solutions to polynomial systems. We assume that the coefficients for a polynomial system are given by parameters. (In engineering applications, these would be derived from physical parameters.) Since the coefficients themselves can be the parameters, this is completely general. We show that by considering the space of parameters (instead of the space of coefficients), we can exploit any special structure the coefficient-parameter formulas impose on the solution set. In particular, we prove that we can ignore generic positive-dimensional solution sets. We also show that any ``side conditions'' (additional equations) can be used to reduce the number of paths. These results unify and generalize all current approaches to polynimial continuation. The effect of these new results is to greatly increase the efficiency of polynomial continuation in several engineering areas. For example, we establish a 36-path homotopy for a electrocardiographic application that needed 193 paths under the previous most appropriate theory. Also, we show that a 16-path homotopy suffices for the inverse kinematics problem for 6-revolute-joint manipulators, a problem previously requiring 32 paths.},

  abstract = {Several arboreal mammals have the ability to rapidly and repeatedly jump vertical distances of 2 m, starting from rest. We characterize this performance by a metric we call vertical jumping agility. Through basic kinetic relations, we show that this agility metric is fundamentally constrained by available actuator power. Although rapid high jumping is an important performance characteristic, the ability to control forces during stance also appears critical for sophisticated behaviors. The animal with the highest vertical jumping agility, the galago (Galago senegalensis), is known to use a power-modulating strategy to obtain higher peak power than that of muscle alone. Few previous robots have used series-elastic power modulation (achieved by combining series-elastic actuation with variable mechanical advantage), and because of motor power limits, the best current robot has a vertical jumping agility of only 55\% of a galago. Through use of a specialized leg mechanism designed to enhance power modulation, we constructed a jumping robot that achieved 78\% of the vertical jumping agility of a galago. Agile robots can explore venues of locomotion that were not previously attainable. We demonstrate this with a wall jump, where the robot leaps from the floor to a wall and then springs off the wall to reach a net height that is greater than that accessible by a single jump. Our results show that series-elastic power modulation is an actuation strategy that enables a clade of vertically agile robots.
Animal agility studies inspired a leg mechanism that improves power modulation and a high-jumping and wall-jumping robot.

  abstract = {This paper describes a synthesis technique that constrains a spatial serial chain into a single degree-of-freedom mechanism using planar six-bar function generators. The synthesis process begins by specifying the target motion of a serial chain that is parameterized by time. The goal is to create a mechanism with a constant velocity rotary input that will achieve that motion. To do this, we solve the inverse kinematics equations to find functions of each serial joint angle with respect to time. Since a constant velocity input is desired, time is proportional to the angle of the input link, and each serial joint angle can be expressed as functions of the input angle. This poses a separate function generator problem to control each joint of the serial chain. Function generators are linkages that coordinate their input and output angles. Each function is synthesized using a technique that finds 11 position Stephenson II linkages, which are then packaged onto the serial chain. Using pulleys and the scaling capabilities of function generating linkages, the final device can be packaged compactly. We describe this synthesis procedure through the design of a biomimetic device for reproducing a flapping wing motion.},

For battery-powered, DC motor-driven systems with gears and cranks, the drive torque and velocity is a complicated function of battery voltage. Hence, resonant behavior is not as well defined as for flapping-wing systems with elastic actuators. In this paper, we analyze a resonant drive to reduce average battery power consumption for DC motor-driven flapping-wing robots. We derive a nondimensionalized analysis of the generic class of a motor-driven slider crank, considering motor and battery resistance. This analysis is used to demonstrate the benefits of efficient resonant drive on a 5.8 g flapping-wing robot and experiments showed a 30\% average power reduction by integrating a tuned compliant element.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm, namely, cyclic coefficient-parameter continuation~(CCPC), that computes only the zero-dimensional finite roots of large systems of polynomial equations, with B\'ezout numbers of the order of millions, arising in the synthesis of mechanisms. The new method is applied to a well-known problem of nine precision-point path synthesis of four-bar linkages to compare it with the established methods, such as regeneration and finite root generation~(FRG). In comparison with the existing methods, the CCPC algorithm is shown to economise computational efforts. The simple termination criterion of the algorithm is useful in estimating the finite root-counts of previously unsolved problems. A new root-count of~5754, as opposed to the previously known root-count of 5743, is estimated to the problem of six precision-point rigid-body guidance of planar Watt-I linkage with its base link specified a priori. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the problem of eight precision-point rigid-body guidance of the Watt-I linkage, of which the solution is not reported in the literature. A finite root-count estimate of 840,300~cognate pairs is obtained. Numerical examples of physical nature are studied and several feasible solutions to these examples are reported.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a design methodology for Stephenson II six-bar function generators that coordinate 11 input and output angles. A complex number formulation of the loop equations yields 70 quadratic equations in 70 unknowns, which is reduced to a system of ten eighth degree polynomial equations of total degree 810=1.07\texttimes{}109. These equations have a monomial structure which yields a multihomogeneous degree of 264,241,152. A sequence of polynomial homotopies was used to solve these equations and obtain 1,521,037 nonsingular solutions. Contained in these solutions are linkage design candidates which are evaluated to identify cognates, and then analyzed to determine their input\textendash{}output angles in each assembly. The result is a set of feasible linkage designs that reach the required accuracy points in a single assembly. As an example, three Stephenson II function generators are designed, which provide the input\textendash{}output functions for the hip, knee, and ankle of a humanoid walking gait.},
